Brief introduction
======
My interests mainly focus on differential equations and dynamical systems, complex networks, and complex systems. Currently, I have published several papers as the first author and corresponding author, including Neural Networks, Chaos, Chaos, Solitaons&Fractals, Nonlinear Dynamics, IJBC, PRE, and other well-known journals in nonlinear systems and mathematics
