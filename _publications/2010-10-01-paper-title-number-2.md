This paper investigates the dynamics of a directed acyclic neural network by edge adding control. We find that
the local stability and Hopf bifurcation of the controlled network only depend on the size and intersection of
directed cycles, instead of the number and position of the added edges. More specifically, if there is no cycle
in the controlled network, the local dynamics of the network will remain unchanged and Hopf bifurcation will
not occur even if the number of added edges is sufficient. However, if there exist cycles, then the network may
undergo Hopf bifurcation. Our results show that the cycle structure is a necessary condition for the generation
of Hopf bifurcation, and the bifurcation threshold is determined by the number, size, and intersection of cycles.
Numerical experiments are provided to support the validity of the theory.
