In this paper, we study the stability and bifurcation behavior of a three-dimensional melanoma
model with immune response. The system has at least one and at most three positive equilibria. It
is proved that the system undergoes Hopf bifurcation and saddle-node bifurcation at the positive
equilibrium. We investigate the direction of Hopf bifurcation and stability of the bifurcating
periodic solution by center manifold theorem and normal form theory. Moreover, codimension
two bifurcations of the system are analyzed. We demonstrate the existence of Bautin bifurcation
and Bogdanov–Takens bifurcation of the system. The normal form of Bautin bifurcation and
Bogdanov–Takens bifurcation are given. Finally, some numerical simulations are demonstrated
to support our theoretical results, and the importance of some parameters of the system is
discussed, in particular the activation rate of CD8+T cells.
